1) f(x) [0,10] -> sin(x) step 1
2) create another array defined from 0 -> 10 but step 0.1 and which function is sin(x)
3) create a subroutine similar to linear_interpolation where xa ya are arrays BUT x and y are not points but values
& which output is the interpolation
-> function that automatically locates the two points determining the surrounding points
